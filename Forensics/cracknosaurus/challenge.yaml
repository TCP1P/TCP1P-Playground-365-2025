  Budi is a vocational school student and a famous hacker in his class and has the mindset that things that exist in the real world can actually also be created in the digital world.
  Therefore, Budi tried to make a digital dinosaur called **Cracknosaurus** in the hope that the digital dinosaur he made could rule the world like the ancient dinosaurs of ancient times.

  **Cracknosaurus** may look like an ordinary file, but you wouldn't know what Budi is hiding in this really extraordinary cracknosaurus image.

  ## Hints
  Cracknosaurus actually have a digital friend, namely **rockyousaurus**, which when combined can solve everything.
