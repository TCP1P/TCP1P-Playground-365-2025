    I just created secret message in image file but i want to make it secure
    so i transform it to audio file. But i think it's not secure enough so i
    archive it with password. I encrypt it with very strong password. I'am
    sure no one can crack it because my password is random 15 digit number in
    base 3. It's very very secure right? ... right??. Then i wrap my file
    within an image so no one can realize.

    flag = TCF2024{`<my secret message>`}

flags:
    - TCF2024{w0w_congrats_you_win}
value: 1000
