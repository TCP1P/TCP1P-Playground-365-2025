  A friend of mine said he had installed a peculiar font on my system. However, it looked pretty much the same when I tried to use it. After a while, he confessed that he had been messing around with the mapping table, making it possible to store a certain amount of information on it

flags:
  - TCP1P{pr3tty_n4sty_cmap_table_isnt?}
provide: ./releases/Document.docx
hints:
  - A single-font may come with multiple encoding tables to ensure compatibility across different platforms
